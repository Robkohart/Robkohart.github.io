		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
		
		<p>HI! My name is Rob Kohart I am an active video game player and a just starting out game devoloper and I was hoping to share some games that I think any aspiring devoloper should play and why I believe that. Some background on me, I have been playing videogames since I was 4 years old when my brothers first let me start on there N64 and it was love at first sight. I transitioned to PC when I turned 8 and became an avid gamer sinking many hours into classics like StarCraft and Quake.
