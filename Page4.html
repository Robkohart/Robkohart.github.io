	<h3> Why Should you play them? </h3>
	<center> <p> The Mass Effect Franchise is a good one to play for a lot of reasons. First of all the story barring the ending to the last game is a masterpiece that showcases the edge of what video games as a medium were capable of with cross game save files and decisions that actively influenced the story to some degree. It also illustrates the dangers of this method of devoloping a game as more major choices are made you as a devoloper must make more content for each possible branch. Additionally it is a good look at building characters over time and how to keep them dynamic and likeable.  </p> </center>
