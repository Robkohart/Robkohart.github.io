	<h3> Why Should you play it? </h3>
	<center> <p> StarCraft is a great example of competitive online gameplay boiled down to its very core. The game allows you to find out very effectively which player is better than the other in an asymetrical balance which was never done before it. It also contains a compelling story told in a very simple manner in a time before effective CGI. Additionally it has just undergone a massive graphics remaster meaning that it is ready to be replayed. </p> </center>
