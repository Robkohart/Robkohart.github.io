	<h2>What is Quake? </h2>
	<center> <p> Quake is a highspeed first person shooter. In my opinion the Quake franchise was the real start of competitive first person shooters and can teach alot about how to make things feel responsive to a player in the first person perspective.  </p></center>
	
	<h3> Why Should you play it? </h3>
	<center> <p> Aside from being a good look at how to make first person perspective feel right Quake also showcases one of the first cases of team based online play competitively. It also helps to show that a franchise does not have to change its core gameplay in order to continue to be popular as long as you can innovate on the fringes. If the core game is solid people will love it for years.  </p> </center>
